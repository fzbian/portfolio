At the moment I am a self-taught student that in my childhood and adolescence I have explored many technologies that have helped me to develop my professional life.

I like to be curious with technologies in order to create new things, innovate, repair and help where I can.

I started when I was 14 years old when I learned the Pawn programming language, a language based on C, I used this language to create game servers at the time and have fun.

At the moment I'm focusing on the Go programming language, a very powerful language with a lot of future, this language has made me realize that my thing is the Backend.
